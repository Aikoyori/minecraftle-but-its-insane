                    <li>If your guess is incorrect, some of the grid may be coloured to give you feedback</li>
                    <li>If the square remains grey, the ingredient you placed here is not in the recipe, hmmm...</li>

                    <li>A green square means the ingredient placed on that square is correct and in the right spot!</li>
