# Minecraftle but it's absolutely insane

A daily puzzle game fusing Wordle and Minecraft crafting recipes built with Flask and JavaScript.

[Play Original Minecraftle](https://minecraftle.zachmanson.com)

## Running

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

## Why?

I thought the original Minecraftle was a little limited in terms of recipes so I made a version where you can craft anything.

## Features

- Every ingredient items ever
- Updated to 1.20 !
- Better Item Rendering !
- 3am coding
